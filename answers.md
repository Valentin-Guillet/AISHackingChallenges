# Client-side Protections

- 10 points: button is `disabled`, remove this and click the button
- 15 points: the API is available through `ButtonClicker_{}` properties, such as `ButtonClicker_num_clicks` that we can modify directly
- 25 points: get the input element and set its value directly: `document.getElementById(...).value = {flag}`
- 50 points: the `paid` flag is included in the payload of the request, so copy/edit/resend the request in order to set `paid = true`


# Programming

- 15 point: cf. js file
- 75 points: after pressing the submit button enough times, a debug message with a random seed appears, we can then regenerate the OTP using python `random.randint()` function
